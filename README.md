# specialist-server

Wouldn't it be neat to define your entire API with [spec?](https://clojure.org/guides/spec)

GraphQL is a query language for APIs. Specialist-server is a tool for fulfilling those queries in your application, with spec. 

More info on GraphQL:

* [Project](http://graphql.org/)
* [Specification](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/)
* [Reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)

(This project is an implementation of the specification but otherwise the author has no affiliation with creators of GraphQL.)
